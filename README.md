Following notebooks have been coded in Python/Numpy without the use of deep learning, or machine learning libraries (with exception of sklearn.datasets in SVM), for the purpose of developing a deeper understanding of machine learning algorithms. None of these are intended as production code. 

[Convolutional Neural Network (Python/Numpy)](https://github.com/peterco877/datascience/blob/master/convolutional_nets_NumPy.ipynb) Network is trained on the CIFAR10 images using batch gradient descent. 

[Support Vector Machines (linear kernel)](https://github.com/peterco877/datascience/blob/master/SVM.ipynb)  

[Support Vector Machines (gaussian kernel)](https://github.com/peterco877/datascience/blob/master/SVM_RBF.ipynb) 

[Radial Basis Functions](https://github.com/peterco877/datascience/blob/master/RBF.ipynb) (I) Use of gamma parameter for interpolation, (II) RBF Classifer, and (III) RBF Networks

[Adaboost Classifier](https://github.com/peterco877/datascience/blob/master/AdaBoost_algorithm.ipynb)  

The following code uses Tensorflow library.
